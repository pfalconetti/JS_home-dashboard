# JS_home-dashboard
A simple HTML/JS/Jquery dashboard displaying temperature, humidity, power consumption, weather icons, and threshold alerts.

Download the files, call the JS functions with the values from your sensors, and run the index.html .

Nota bene: weather icons are "Meteocons" by @Bluxart (http://www.alessioatzeni.com/meteocons).
